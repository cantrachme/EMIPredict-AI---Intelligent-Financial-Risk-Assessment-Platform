# 💳 EMIPredict AI – Intelligent Financial Risk Assessment Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
**EMIPredict AI** is an intelligent financial risk assessment platform designed to help individuals and financial institutions make **data-driven EMI and loan decisions**. The platform combines **machine learning models**, **advanced feature engineering**, and **MLflow experiment tracking** within an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The system solves two core machine learning problems:
- **Classification** – Predict EMI eligibility (Eligible / High Risk / Not Eligible)
- **Regression** – Predict the maximum safe monthly EMI amount

Built using a large-scale dataset of **400,000 realistic financial records**, the project demonstrates an end-to-end production-ready ML workflow in the **FinTech and Banking** domain.
